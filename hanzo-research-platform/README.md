### Project status

 * Currently under development. First parts have been made, but nothing tested yet.*
 
### Support

 - If you appreciate this project you can support me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jensdyvik)
 - If you have design ideas and feedabck, pull requests and git issues are most welcome

### What

 - A cartesian machine with a 3m x 1,4m x 1,5m work area
 - Able to print rough and fast 
 - With a toolchanger system
 - With dual pinion drive for electronic pretension _(less backlash, higher cost and complexity)_
 - Tailor made to experiment with automation and machine making
 
### Why

 - I need a large machine with a lot of flexibility to do the research that I wont to do the coming years
 - If I have machine with a 3m long work area I can make machines with a 2,44m work area _(standard sheet size)_ for my local community in a single piece
 - I wan to make environmentally friendlier manufacturing methods more available
 - I want to making automation in digital fabrication more accessible

### How

 - I am looking to CNC mill almost all the the parts _(frame, rack, rails)_ from 12mm thick Trespa or other phenolic resin paper composite sheets
 

### Files

 - I am designing Hanzo in [Freecad]() *(free and open CAD software)*
 - I work in the open and publish and update the files in the [project folder](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/tree/master/hanzo-research-platform) of this repo
 - I also export .step files from freecad to the the [project folder](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/tree/master/hanzo-research-platform) that you can import into programs like Fusion360, Solidworks, Rhino etc.


### Log: August 2021

 - The first parts of the machine has been fabricated. Making of video [here](https://youtu.be/XLuoENFNSG0)
