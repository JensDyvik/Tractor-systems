### Project status

 - Early sketching phase
 
### What

  - An easy to fab CNC router
  - 1250mm wide work area
  - Work area lengths from 600mm to 2460mm.
  - Able to cut up 50mm thick materials
  - Designed to be able to self replicate *(can make most of its own parts)*.
  - Design to be simple yet robust
  - Uses our [CNC friendly rack and pinion](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/wiki/Modules#cnc-friendly-rack-and-pinion) with a 5:1 precision gearbox
  - The machine is the successor to our [Humphrey](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/blob/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/README.md) large format CNC.
